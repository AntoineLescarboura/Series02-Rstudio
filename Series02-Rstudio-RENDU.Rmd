## 2.1 Make clear what is a statistical test, and when to use it.
Below are some questions to guide your analysis. You can answer them in your notebook, with a short sentence for each question.

- What is a median? A mean?

A median is the value right in the middle between the maximum and the minimum of the dataset.
A mean is the average of all the values of the dataset.  


- What is a variance? A standard deviation?

The variance is the measure of data spread, the average squared deviation from the mean.
The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.


- What is a normal distribution?

A normal distribution is when the values are symetrical around the mean value. Graphicly, it has the shape of a bell.


- What is a statistical test?

A statistical test is a test that allows to decide of data support or reject the hypothesis H0 that was chosen before the test.


- When to use a statistical test?

When we need to determine of a result is statistically significant or if it's due to chance or hazard.


- What is a parametric test? A non-parametric test?

A parametric test is a test where we assume a specific distribution. On the other end, a non-parametric test is where there are no distribution assumptions.


- What are the assumptions of parametric tests?

Normality, homogeneity of variances, independence of observations.


- What are the assumptions of non-parametric tests?

Often require independent samples and ordinal/continuous data.


- What is a p-value?

The p-value is the probability of obtaining data as extreme as observed, under the null hypothesis.
It allows to know if there's a correlation between two datasets.


- What is the risk of error when using a statistical test?

The risk of error in a statistical test means either rejecting a true null hypothesis (Type I error) or failing to reject a

- What is the difference between a paired and an unpaired test?

A paired test compare measurements on the the same subjects before and after treatments while an unpaired test compare measurements between different groups.
